# Code Challenge-03 Whiteboarding

## Problem Domain:

Write a function which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## In/Out

> > Input: Array of n elements , value.
> > Output: Array with the `value` in the middle of it.

## Edge cases:

- Empty array
- Null
- Not an array

## Visulization

  - In: [9,-2,0,4,3] ,5
  - Out:[9,-2,0, 5, 4, 3]


## Big-O: Look at the code below


## Algortihm:
    1. check if the the length of the array ia even or odd 
    2. if its even itreat over the first half and append all th half element to the new array
    3. append the `value` to the middle of the new array
    4. append the second half to the new array
    5. the same if the the array is odd but we will append to the middle of the array as if it even (length+1)


## Pseudo Code

    1. Define new array
    2. if the array even 
    3. loop over range of 0 - length/2
    4. appned the first half
    5. appned the `value`
    6. loop over range of  length/2 - length
    7. appned the second half
    8. if the array odd 
    9. loop over range of 0 - (length+1)/2
    10. appned the first half
    11. appned the `value`
    12. loop over range of  (length+1)/2 - length
    13. appned the second half


## Code

```python
def shfit_array(arr, value):
    if not( type(a) == type([]) ): # If not array
        return 'error'             # 1 time only
    new_array =[]                  # 1 time only
    length = len(arr)              # 1 time only
    if length % 2 == 0:            # if even       
      middle = int(length/2)       # 1 time only
      new_array = arr[0:middle]+[value]+ arr[middle:length] # 1 time only
      return print(new_array)      # 1 time only 
    if length % 2 != 0:            # if odd
        middle = int((length+1)/2) # 1 time only
        new_array = arr[0:middle]+[value]+ arr[middle:length]  # 1 time only
        return print(new_array)    # 1 time only
```

Complexity = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = constants
Time Complexity = O(1)



## Verification:

```
In: a = [3, 4, 6, 7] , value = 5
expected Out: [3, 4, 5 , 6, 7]
so lenght = 4  and 4%2= 0 then  middle= int(4/2)=2
new_array =arr[0:2]+[5]+[2:4]
          =[3,4,5,6,7]   # verified 

In : a[5,5,5,5,5] , value =0
expected Out: [5, 5, 5 ,0,5,5]
so lenght = 5  and 5%2 != 0 then  middle= int(5+1/2)=3
new_array =arr[0:3]+[0]+[3:5]
          =[5,5,5,0,5,5]   # verified 
```
