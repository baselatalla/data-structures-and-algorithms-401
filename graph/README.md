# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Challenge

The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* add node
    -Arguments: value
    -Returns: The added node
    -Add a node to the graph

* add edge
    -Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight    (optional)
    -Returns: nothing
    -Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    -If specified, assign a weight to the edge
    -Both nodes should already be in the Graph

* get nodes
    -Arguments: none
    -Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

* get neighbors
    -Arguments: node
    -Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
        -Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

* size
    -Arguments: none
    -Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency

O(1)

## API

* add node
    -Arguments: value
    -Returns: The added node
    -Add a node to the graph

* add edge
    -Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight    (optional)
    -Returns: nothing
    -Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    -If specified, assign a weight to the edge
    -Both nodes should already be in the Graph

* get nodes
    -Arguments: none
    -Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

* get neighbors
    -Arguments: node
    -Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
        -Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

* size
    -Arguments: none
    -Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
